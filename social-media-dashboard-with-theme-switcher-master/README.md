This project is a solution to the **Social Media Dashboard with Theme Toggle**
challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2024** as part of my early front-end learning journey and is
kept as a reference rather than a fully refactored example.

---

## Overview

A dashboard-style layout that displays:
- Total follower counts across platforms
- Daily overview metrics (likes, views, retweets, etc.)
- A light / dark theme toggle

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (theme handled via `data-theme` attribute)
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks or build tools were used.

---

## JavaScript Logic

- A checkbox toggle switches between **light** and **dark** themes
- The theme is applied by updating a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element
- CSS handles the visual changes based on the active theme

The logic is intentionally simple and imperative, reflecting my learning stage
at the time.

---

## What I Practiced

- Building dashboard-style layouts
- Using CSS variables with theme attributes
- DOM selection and event handling
- Toggling global UI state

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

- Original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behavior are intentionally preserved
- Additional class names were added later for readability only
- No visual or functional changes were made
