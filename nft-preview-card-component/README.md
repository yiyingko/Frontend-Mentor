This project is a solution to the **NFT Preview Card Component** challenge from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2023** as part of my early front-end learning journey and is
kept as a reference rather than a fully reworked example.

---

## Overview

The component displays an NFT preview card with:
- Image hover overlay
- Title and description
- Price and time metadata
- Creator information

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

No JavaScript or frameworks were used.

---

## What I Practiced

- Card-based UI layout
- Image overlays using layered elements
- Flexbox alignment
- Working with design assets from Frontend Mentor

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

- Original CSS is intentionally preserved
- Additional class names were added to improve HTML readability
- No visual or functional changes were made

This repository represents a **snapshot of progress**, not a modern refactor.
