# Pricing Component with Toggle

![Screenshot from 2024-06-26 21-17-36](https://github.com/yiyingko/Frontend-Mentor/assets/115703682/3506abac-208a-4a34-86c5-535e1151d2ba)

This project is a solution to the **Pricing Component with Toggle** challenge from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2024** as part of my early front-end and JavaScript learning journey and is kept as a reference rather than a fully refactored or modernized example.

---

## Overview

The page displays three pricing plans and allows users to toggle between:

* **Monthly pricing**
* **Annual pricing**

The toggle updates the displayed prices without reloading the page.

---

## Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks or build tools were used.

---

## JavaScript Logic

All interactivity is handled inline and in a small script at the bottom of the HTML.

Key behaviors:

* A checkbox toggle controls whether **monthly** or **yearly** prices are shown
* Prices are switched by toggling the `hidden` class on elements
* DOM elements are selected using class-based selectors
* Logic is intentionally simple and imperative

This reflects my understanding at the time and focuses on direct DOM manipulation rather than abstraction.

---

## What I Practiced

* Building a pricing layout with multiple cards
* Implementing a toggle switch UI
* Basic DOM querying and class toggling
* Handling simple UI state with JavaScript

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

* Original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behavior are intentionally preserved
* Additional class names were added later to improve readability only
* No functional or visual changes were made during the tidy-up

This repository represents a **snapshot of learning**, not a production-ready component.
