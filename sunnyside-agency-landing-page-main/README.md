This project is a solution to the **Sunnyside Agency Landing Page** challenge
from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2024** as part of my early front-end learning journey and is
kept as a reference rather than a fully refactored example.

## Overview

A multi-section marketing landing page featuring:
- Hero header with navigation
- Content sections with imagery
- Service highlights
- Client testimonials
- Image gallery
- Footer with social links

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

No JavaScript frameworks were used.

---

## What I Practiced

- Building a multi-section page layout
- Navigation and hero composition
- Combining text and imagery for marketing content
- Working from a detailed design specification

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

- Original CSS and structure are intentionally preserved
- Additional class names were added to improve HTML readability
- No visual or functional changes were made

This repository represents a **snapshot of learning**, not a production-ready
site.
