This project is a solution to the **Four Card Feature Section** challenge from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2024** as part of my early front-end learning journey and is
kept as a reference rather than a polished, production-level example.

## Overview

The layout presents four feature cards arranged in a responsive grid with a
central emphasis on hierarchy and symmetry.

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid)

No JavaScript or frameworks were used.

---

## What I Practiced

- Structuring a multi-column layout
- Using CSS Grid for visual symmetry
- Building reusable card components
- Working from a design specification

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

- Original CSS is intentionally preserved
- Additional class names were added to improve HTML readability
- No visual or functional changes were made

This repository reflects a **snapshot of progress**, not a reworked version.
