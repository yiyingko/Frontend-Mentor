This project is a solution to the **Single Price Grid Component** challenge from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2024** as part of my early front-end learning journey and is
kept as a reference rather than a fully reworked example.

## Overview

A pricing layout with:
- Intro section (headline + description)
- Monthly subscription plan with a call-to-action
- “Why Us” list of benefits

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

No JavaScript or frameworks were used.

---

## What I Practiced

- Building a simple multi-section layout
- Typography hierarchy
- Card/grid styling with CSS
- Translating a design spec into HTML/CSS

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

- Original CSS is intentionally preserved
- Additional class names were added to improve HTML readability
- No visual or functional changes were made

This repository represents a **snapshot of progress**, not a modern refactor.
