# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various **Frontend Mentor** challenges.  
Instead of creating a separate repository for each challenge, I organise them as **individual sub-projects (folders)** inside this main repo for clarity and maintainability.

Each folder represents one challenge and contains its own source code, assets, and (where relevant) a dedicated README with implementation notes.

## 🚀 What I Focus On

Across these challenges, I aim to practice and demonstrate:

* Semantic HTML & accessible markup
* Modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, responsive layouts)
* Mobile-first and responsive design
* JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation
* Code organisation and readability
* Progressive refactoring and improvement

Some projects are intentionally simple, while others explore more complex logic or component structure.

## 📝 Notes

* Challenges vary in complexity and completion level.
* Some older solutions may be revisited and refactored as my skills evolve.
* Individual folders may include additional notes about design decisions or learning takeaways.
