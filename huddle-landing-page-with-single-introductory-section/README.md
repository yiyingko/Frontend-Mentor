This project is a solution to the **Huddle Landing Page with Single Introductory
Section** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built in **2023** as part of my early front-end learning journey and is
kept as a reference rather than a fully polished example.

---

## Overview

A simple landing page featuring:
- Brand header with logo
- Introductory hero section with illustration and copy
- Call-to-action button
- Social media links

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

No JavaScript or frameworks were used.

---

## What I Practiced

- Building a basic landing page layout
- Working with SVG icons
- Aligning media and text content
- Translating a design into static markup

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

- Original CSS is intentionally preserved
- Additional class names were added to improve HTML readability
- No visual or functional changes were made

This repository represents a **snapshot of progress**, not a modern refactor.
